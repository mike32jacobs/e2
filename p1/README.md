## Game planning
_In plain english - no code - think through how you'll make this game work. Example:_
+ _Create an array of two options, heads and tails._
+ _Name one player Mike, and the other player Kara
+ _Randomly choose one of these options from the array and assign it as Mike's move_
+ _Randomly choose one of these options from the array and assign it as Kara's move_
+ _Check to see if Mike's move is the same as Kara's move or different than Kara's move_
+_If the moves are the same, Mike gets one point and Kara loses one point_
+_If the moves are different, Mike loses one point and Kara gets one point_
+ _Report the results of Mike's Move, Kara's move, Output should also explain what player earned a point and what player lost a point_
